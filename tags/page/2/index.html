I was working on a Vue project (CLI) with some gsap powered animations that I did not write. Not having written them, I can confess that I have no idea what they are or what they do.

The Urlist is an application that lets you create lists of url’s that you can share with others. Get it? A list of URL’s? The Urlist? Listen, naming things is hard and all the good domains are already taken.

As a result, people like me (which is most of us — zero evidence to prove that so just accept it as fact and let it wash over you) tend to learn the base amount of Git that we need to get by (clone, pull, add, commit) and the rest we try really hard to avoid because we have zero confidence that we’ll be able to do it without breaking literally everything....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer><time>December 7, 2018</time></footer><a class=entry-link href=https://burkeholland.github.io/posts/git-lens-eric/></a></article><footer class=page-footer><nav class=pagination><a class=prev href=/tags/>← Prev Page</a></nav></footer></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2021 <a href=https://burkeholland.github.io/>Burke Knows Words</a></span>
