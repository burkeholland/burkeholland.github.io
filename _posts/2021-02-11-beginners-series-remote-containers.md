> "Knowledge isn't free. You have to pay attention."

Ok, but all "play on words" aside, knowledge **is** free. That's the key contribution of the internet, isn't it? That all knowledge is now essentially free? And this is kind of a recent development. It used to cost quite a bit to learn the skills that will make you successful. I mean, there is still a [700 billion dollar industry](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cud.asp#:~:text=In%202017%E2%80%9318%2C%20total%20revenues,at%20private%20for%2Dprofit%20institutions.) built on selling you knowledge.

Even better, you can learn what you _need_ instead of things that you _might_ need. It's been several decades and I have not once used "[Slope Intercept Form](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:forms-of-linear-equations/x2f8bb11595b61c86:intro-to-slope-intercept-form/a/introduction-to-slope-intercept-form)". NOT. ONCE. Well, that's a lie, I had to use it to help my kid with his homework at which point I Googled it. Like an adult. 

But this post is not a shot at Algebra (I love you math people - really I do), this is about MORE free knowledge. Specficially, an 8 part video series on how to use "Development Containers".

> If you prefer reading to videos (you do you) you can get this whole series as [step-by-step tutorial on Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/use-docker-container-dev-env-vs-code?WT.mc_id=devcloud-11496-buhollan).

## Development Containers

Development Containers (or Dev Containers) are just Docker containers. But we add a little [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download?WT.mc_id=devcloud-11496-buhollan) magic in the form of the [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers&WT.mc_id=devcloud-11496-buhollan) that allows you to develop _inside_ of the container right from the editor. 

Now why would you do this? Because once you define a container definition for a project, you can check it in to source as a config file. Then any developer could immediately spin up the right dev environment with _zero_ configuration. No Python install. No copy/paste cryptic terminal commands from Stack Overflow.

So how does this work? I'm glad you asked! Or didn't ask! Either way, queue up episode 1...

### Episode 1:
