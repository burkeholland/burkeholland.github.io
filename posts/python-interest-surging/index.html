What&rsquo;s even more interesting is that if you expand the time range to 2 years, Python drops off the list completely. So in the past 12 months, Python has gone from &ldquo;not on the list&rdquo; to &ldquo;in the top 5&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s quite the movement.</p><h3 id=why-python>Why Python?</h3><p>One of the reasons could be the overall meteoric rise of Python. In December, Stack Overflow reported that it was the <a href=https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies>4th most popular technology</a> on their site, beating out Java by 4 percentage points. This was <a href=https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology>also true in 2019</a>, but only by a razor thin margin when compared to Java. In 2018, <a href=https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#technology>it was number 7</a> overall with Java enjoying a 7 point lead.</p><p>Stack Overflow is only one measurement and certainly pulls only from the &ldquo;Stack Overflow&rdquo; demographic. The TIOBE index attempts to rate based on an aggregation of the &ldquo;number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors.&rdquo; According to <a href=https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/>TIOBE&rsquo;s February 2021 numbers</a>, Python is number 3, beaten only Java with the leader being C? Which, I was onboard until &ldquo;C&rdquo;. That seems hard to believe.</p><p>So Python is popular, but why is <em>that</em>?</p><p>There are a lot of potential reasons. Certainly one is that Python is a popular language for students.</p><p>This is because it&rsquo;s syntatically easier to write than it&rsquo;s C-based counterparts. It is also dynamic, which means that it doesn&rsquo;t require a compilation step. And possibly most important of all - it skirts around the painfully abstract &ldquo;object-oriented&rdquo; programming model. I spent far more <strong>time</strong> trying to understand classes and inheritance than I ever did using them.</p><p>There is also the rise in popularity of data science as a profession. Although I remain skeptical of this. I still don&rsquo;t know anyone who works as a &ldquo;data scientist&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m not saying the job doesn&rsquo;t exist - I know that it does. And a lot of other people must expect that it does too, because &ldquo;Data scientist or machine learning specialist&rdquo; is the <a href=https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#work-whos-actively-looking-for-a-job>#2 on people &ldquo;actively looking for a job&rdquo;</a> on the same Stack Overflow survey I referenced earlier. But it only occupies <a href=https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#developer-roles>8% of the total available roles</a>. I&rsquo;m just saying that perhaps the hype is a lot bigger than the demand.</p><h2 id=python-is-big>Python is big</h2><p>All arguments on what people are doing with Python aside, it&rsquo;s certainly popular even by Google Trends standards - even when you <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> searching for it. That&rsquo;s a measurement that is quite hard to deny.
