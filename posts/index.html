Today, it’s gone, but still in the top related queries along with “how to format code”.

During the day when your body is more awake, it might make more sense to use a light theme where reading comprehension is better. At night, your eyes become more tired and bright screen light can be harder on your tired eyes.
Visual Studio Code doesn’t do this out-of-the-box, but just like Steve Jobs once said, “There’s an extension for that”....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer><time>February 16, 2021</time></footer><a class=entry-link href=https://burkeholland.github.io/posts/vscode/auto-switch-themes/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2>Beginner's series to Dev Containers free video course</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>"Knowledge isn't free.

Optimistic because we really need to get humans out of the business of writing code wherever we can. Less code means less bugs.

I’m assuming that unless your name is “Dr. Dre”, you probably do not have a professional sound studio in your basement full of high-end equipment and expensive software. And if you’re like me, you don’t even have a basement.
What I do have is a Blue Yeti microphone, GarageBand and a copy of Screenflow that I can barely afford....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer><time>March 18, 2020</time></footer><a class=entry-link href=https://burkeholland.github.io/posts/audio-how-to/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2>Trimming expenses on The Urlist with Azure Cosmos DB Free Tier</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>Summary: We migrated theurlist.com to the new Cosmos DB Free Tier and shaved ~35$ per month off of our Azure bill.

For the uninitiated in database street-slang, CRUD means Create, Read, Update And Delete. Feel free to use that if you find yourself in a turf war or dance-off.
Well, I take that back. I can “read” everything purty gud. Actually, I can “create” as well.

So wise! So profound. So obnoxiously vain to use your own quote.
“Serverless”, is a buzzword. We can’t seem to agree on what it actaully means, so it ends up meaning nothing at all. Much like “cloud” or “dynamic” or “synergy”. You just wait for the right time in a meeting to drop it, walk to the board and draw a Venn Diagram, and then just sit back and wait for your well-deserved promotion....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer><time>January 13, 2020</time></footer><a class=entry-link href=https://burkeholland.github.io/posts/laws-of-serverless/></a></article><footer class=page-footer><nav class=pagination><a class=next href=/posts/page/2/>Next Page →</a></nav></footer></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2021 <a href=https://burkeholland.github.io/>Burke Knows Words</a></span>
