I remain optimistic, but skeptical in regards to the idea that some day anyone will be able to build apps.</p><p>Optimistic because we really need to get humans out of the business of writing code wherever we can. Less code means less bugs. Skeptical because in the 15 years I&rsquo;ve been a developer, I&rsquo;ve watched so many of these tools come and go. The problem isn&rsquo;t that we haven&rsquo;t made the right tools, it&rsquo;s that you still need to have significant level of technical knowledge about <em>how</em> a problem can be solved. And that&rsquo;s not something you can abstract away with a nicer UI.</p><p>I think the strongest case for the success of NoLow at the moment has more to do with what it offers current developers than it&rsquo;s ability to turn non-coders into application developers.</p><h2 id=a-nolow-real-world-use-case>A NoLow real world use case</h2><p>My wife owns a small business. It&rsquo;s one of those yard sign businesses that have exploded in popularity during the pandemic. I was skeptical of the long-term viability of a business built on corrugated blown up letters stuck in your yard, but when she put up a sign for my birthday, it did make me feel special and I can understand why she&rsquo;s getting 5 and 6 orders a day at around 75 bucks a pop.</p><p><img src=/media/low-code-value/yard-sign.JPEG alt="Example yard sign in front of a house"></p><p>I am defacto tech support for all the digital aspects of her business. Since it&rsquo;s a franchise, nearly everything she needs is provided by the company. And, if I might add, it&rsquo;s pretty good. She complains, but she has never used enterprise software before so her only frame of reference is her iPhone, on which everything kind of &ldquo;just works&rdquo;.</p><p>From time to time, she has small automation needs. For instance, she gets orders emailed to her every day. She then has to print those orders out. So she made a simple request to have orders just automatically print out whenever they come in.</p><p>I was halfway to building a Node application that auth&rsquo;d to Gmail, parsed the body with an HTML parser and an npm package to send things to the printer before I realized that this is probably all solvable with low code tools.</p><p>So I built an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow?WT.mc_id=devcloud-15662-buhollan">Azure Logic App</a> that does this in - no joke - two steps.</p><h2 id=building-the-logic-app>Building the Logic App</h2><p>First I had some prep work to do.</p><p>I added a label to any incoming order email with an &ldquo;Order&rdquo; label. Gmail calls these &ldquo;filters&rdquo; by the way. The order format ALWAYS starts the same way and they always come from the same sender. Anybody could write this filter.</p><p><img src=/media/low-code-value/email-filter.jpg alt="Gmail filter screen showing new filter"></p><blockquote><p>Note: the easiest way to do this whole thing would be to forward the email once it comes in via the same filter in Gmail - cause you can do that. Unfortunately, this doesn&rsquo;t work. For some reason, the printer won&rsquo;t accept forwarded emails. I lost about an hour to that weirdness.</p></blockquote><p>I started with a blank Logic App and added the Gmail Trigger to start. It has the ability to check for new mail, and you can even specify a label to filter on.</p><p><img src=/media/low-code-value/gmail-trigger.jpg alt="Logic App showing Gmail Trigger settings"></p><p>The next step is to add an action that sends any emails it found in step one to the printer. I&rsquo;ve got an HP Envy 5640 that supports <a href=https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03721293>HP ePrint</a> - &ldquo;a cloud-based service that lets you print from anywhere&mldr;&rdquo;. Once you set it up, you get a super ugly email address that looks like <code>kslf11skjflk83@hpeprint.com</code>. But anything you send to that ugliness from a &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; sender will print. It works well.</p><p><img src=/media/low-code-value/full-logic-app.jpg alt="Logic App showing Gmail Trigger settings and Gmail send email action"></p><blockquote><p>I put the printer email in a Logic App parameter so it&rsquo;s not part of the program itself. That&rsquo;s the coder in me. I can&rsquo;t help it.</p></blockquote><p>This runs every 3 minutes and prints new orders when they come in.</p><p>And it is deceptively simple.</p><p>Consider what actually has to occur for this to work&mldr;</p><ol><li>Authentication to Gmail on my behalf, implementing an OAuth flow and storing tokens for future requests.</li><li>Querying for any &ldquo;new&rdquo; emails with a particular label</li><li>Parsing the parts of the email and preserving the HTML of the body</li><li>Sending an email on my behalf</li></ol><p>10 years ago we would have coded this from scratch and it would have taken a week - at least. And I would consider this &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; coding given the auth flow requirements. And think of the bugs, testing and maintenance down the line.</p><h2 id=could-anyone-do-this>Could anyone do this?</h2><p>So back to the point - could <em>anyone</em> do this? It is pretty simple. Certainly a user with a moderate amount of technical knowledge could piece the Logic App together. But could they pull the <em>whole</em> thing off by themselves?</p><p>I&rsquo;m not so sure. There are a lot of things that I just glossed over where you could get seriously hung up. Think of what you have to <em>know</em> to build this&mldr;</p><ul><li>You have to know that you need to query a collection of items (emails) based on a condition (label)</li><li>You have to know that modern printers have this &ldquo;email to printer&rdquo; capability which requires you to know the printer&rsquo;s IP address which means&mldr;</li><li>You have to know about IP addresses, that they are dynamic, that this will ultimately break your app which means&mldr;</li><li>That you need to change the printer IP to static which means&mldr;</li><li>You have to know how to log-in to your router and configure DHCP.</li></ul><p>Coding is not just knowledge of a language. It is broad knowledge of platforms, and how systems communicate.</p><p>Optimistic, but skeptical.</p><p>For now, I think that NoLow apps might work for certain types of applications - a la &ldquo;forms over data&rdquo; like Microsoft Access. But the real &ldquo;arrived&rdquo; value might, at least today, seems to be enabling current developers to be more productive. It remains to be seen if developers will adopt these tools in lieu of a lucrative career inventing wheels.</p></div></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2021 <a href=https://burkeholland.dev/>Burke Knows Words</a></span>
