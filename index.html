For the uninitiated in database street-slang, CRUD means Create, Read, Update And Delete. Feel free to use that if you find yourself in a turf war or dance-off.
Well, I take that back. I can “read” everything purty gud. Actually, I can “create” as well.

So wise! So profound. So obnoxiously vain to use your own quote.
“Serverless”, is a buzzword. We can’t seem to agree on what it actaully means, so it ends up meaning nothing at all. Much like “cloud” or “dynamic” or “synergy”. You just wait for the right time in a meeting to drop it, walk to the board and draw a Venn Diagram, and then just sit back and wait for your well-deserved promotion....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer><time>January 13, 2020</time></footer><a class=entry-link href=https://burkeholland.github.io/posts/laws-of-serverless/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2>GSAP, Webpack and invalid tweens</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>Before I forget, I wanted to document for posterity how I lost about 4 hours yesterday to gsap/webpack issue.
